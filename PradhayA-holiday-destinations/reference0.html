                <p><Strong> Zermatt </strong> High in the Valais Alps the village of Zermatt lies beneath the incomparable and legendary Matterhorn. This infamous peak is an ever-present and invigorating sight. All around Zermatt are a host vantage points for photos, and places where you can learn about the people who have conquered the mountain, or died trying. The Matterhorn is just one of 29 peaks higher than 4,000 metres in the Upper Valais region. And in this Alpine playground you can do things that you might not have dreamed possible, like walk through a glacier, go skiing in mid-summer and climb one of Europe’s highest mountains. This is all made feasible by record-breaking infrastructure, from aerial tramways to funiculars, all testifying to human ingenuity in this extreme environment.
                the world.</p>

                </figure>

                <p>There are a wide variety of different attractions to be discovered around the Matterhorn. A top excursion is Gornergrat. On this three-thousand metre mountain ridge there is a viewing platform with a truly unforgettable view of the Matterhorn and the surrounding mountain world. Our if you prefer, the Matterhorn can also be admired from the Rothorn. The Matterhorn glacier paradise is the highest summer ski region in Europe and is open 365 days a year. And there is still plenty to do when the sun isn’t shining! The Matterhorn Museum explains the historic development of Zermatt from a mountain village to an Alpine holiday resort and also has many photographs and facts about the first ascent of the Matterhorn.</p>

                <br>

                <p>One of a few unforgettable excursions in Zermatt is the highest open-air rack railway in Europe.

The Gornergrat Bahn shuttles up to the observation platform at Gornergrat, just over 3,000 metres above sea level through a mountain wilderness where no fewer than 29 peaks rise above 4,000 metres.

It might be hard to believe but the railway was laid as long ago as 1896 when it became the world’s first fully electrified rack line.

The trip takes 33 minutes and the train courses over ravines and through stone pine and larch forest.

Finally you’ll arrive at the platform, in the centre of a small tourist development and where the scenery almost defies description.

The Matterhorn is hard to ignore, but you can also view the Dufourspitze, Switzerland highest mountain at 4,634 metres and the Gorner Glacier, the second-largest in the Alps.</p>

                <br>

                <p>In the shadow of the Matterhorn is the ultimate destination for a ski holiday.

Zermatt is a nexus point of a network of 54 funiculars, lifts and cable-cars and more than 360 kilometres of pistes.

As we’ve seen on the Breithorn plateau skiing is even available in the height of summer because of the glaciers and low temperatures at high altitude.

Lower slopes are blanketed with snow as early and late as November and April for an extended season.

People who want a more intrepid ski experience could hire a mountain guide who knows the terrain like the back of his or her hand and will take you off piste.

There are also dozens of restaurants high in unexpected perches, and a friendly Après Ski in the centre of Zernatt and at stations like Sunnegga.</p>
