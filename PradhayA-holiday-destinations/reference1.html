        <p><span id = "firstWord">Capri</span> The crags and grottoes of Capri have been dazzling visitors since the Ancient Greeks
          first settled the island. It’s easy to understand why artists and writers have been immortalizing Capri’s beauty and history for centuries.
          Climb aboard a wooden boat to tour the Grotto Azzurra, a cave filled with spectacularly blue water. Savor some gelato
          while you stroll around the harbours of Marina Piccola or Marina Grande, an ancient Roman fishing port.</p>

        <p>Capri is a gem radiating a brilliant history through all its different facets.
Its innumerable points of interest allure visitors with their tales of an enchanted past. Its discovery by the ancient Romans is hinted at by countless archaeological finds - e.g.  Villa Jovis, whose construction was commissioned by the Emperor Tiberius.

The Certosa (Basilica) di San Giacomo is an obligatory stop; today it houses a museum exposing two statues that were recovered from the deep Grotta Azzurra.

In Anacapri, the characteristic Casa Rossa (Red House) is a striking piece of work within a gorgeous and colorful landscape: inside is the L'Isola Dipinta ("The Painted Island"), a permanent exposition of images illustrating the island's history and traditions.

Beyond the cultural attractions and sea and nature in all their charm, Capri also offers good shopping: tasteful boutiques and artisans' studios selling “Made in Italy” items and typical products alternate along the characteristic sidestreets and alleyways.

Moreover, the exuberantly-flavored local food is tied to the island's maritime and peasant traditions. </p>

        <p>The sea emerging below is very deep, and harsh jagged caves have formed there. The most famous of these is the Grotta Azzurra or the "Blue Grotto", now known to have been a Roman bathing place. This lagoon is haunted by a dazzling shifting turquoise blue. Small openings in the back of the cave admit daylight which, reflecting on the limestone floor and walls, creates a fantastical and magical atmosphere. It has attracted visitors and inspired awe from all who have seen its ancient limestone walls and learned of the history of this oceanic cave. </p>

        <p>On a hot summer day, beaches in Capri can get really crowded. The best way to experience the incredible water that surrounds the island without the hoards is on a boat. Hire a skipper and spend a few hours swimming in rocky coves and emerald green grottos. If you are short on time, there are also larger crafts which give one hour long tours around the island.</p>

        <p> The Faraglioni - This massive rock formation made up of three separate limestone stacks is one of the first things you see on your way to Capri. They are so large that on a clear day you can even spot the Faraglioni from Amalfi Coast towns like Positano and Praiano. Beloved by islanders and visitors, some of the best views are from the scenic overlook at the end of via Tragara and the flower filled gardens of Augustus. You can swim next to them at the Da Luigi beach club and sail through them on a private boat tour.</p>

      <h2 style= "text-align: center"> Anacapri </h2>
        <p>Did you know that there are two separate towns on the island of Capri? Most visitors only visit Capri town with its well known sites like the Piazzetta, Marina Piccola and the famous shopping streets. There is another world a short bus or taxi ride away on the other side of the island. Anacapri is much more spread out and residential. This is where you can take the chair lift to the top of Monte Solara.</p>

        <p> But is there any specialities of food you may ask? Of course! Naples, the birthplace of pizza, is less than an hour’s boat ride away from Capri. The tasty craft traveled across the bay and there are the particular dome-shaped wood-fired ovens and trained pizzaiolos on the island. Take a break from seafood and spend an evening discovering how a simple margarita pizza and a cold draft beer can be a gourmet experience.</p>
